<p>Now is the turn of a very short story for students. One day Nasir found a crystal ball behind a banyan tree in his garden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tree told him that the crystal ball would grant him a wish, he thought very hard, but could not come up with anything he wanted. So, he kept the crystal ball in his bag and waited till he could decide on his wish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days went by without him making a wish but his best friend saw him looking at the crystal ball. He got curious and stole it from Nasir. He showed it to everyone in the village. Everyone in the village got greedy.</p>
<p>They all asked for palaces and gold, but could not make more than one wish as this was the rule of the crystal ball. In the end, everyone was angry because no one could have everything they desired.</p>
<p>They became very unhappy and decided to ask Nasir for help. Nasir had already decided the wish he wanted everything to become as it once was before the villagers had tried to satisfy their greed. The palaces and gold vanished and the villagers felt happy and content once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore, Moral of The Story is</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Greed never makes a person happy.</span></p>
