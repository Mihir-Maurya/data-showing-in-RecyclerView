<p>It was a hot summer&rsquo;s day. A thirsty crow flew into a village searching for water. The crow had nearly covered the whole village but there was no sign of water. After a long time, he came across a farm. Under one of the trees on the farm was a pitcher of water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy that he found some water finally, he swooped down to the tree and then down to the ground. When he looked inside the pitcher, there was a very little amount of water left.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crow put his beak inside the pitcher but could not reach the water. The water level was too low, and the narrow opening did not allow his neck from going all the way down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He tried to push the vessel down to let the water out, but it was too heavy. The crow was very disappointed. He was really thirsty and needed a drink of water badly. He could have given up and flown to another farm, looking for water. But he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t give up. Instead, he looked around and thought, &ldquo;What else can I do?&rdquo; He saw that there were a lot of pebbles on the farm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, he had a brilliant idea! He collected a few pebbles and dipped them into the pot. After this, As he added more and more stones, the water level came up to the brim. The crow drank the water and went on happily.</p>
