<p>One day, Tenali Raman and his wife were on their way to the small town of Hampi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They stopped at a village on the way to rest and drink water when they noticed that the entire village had gathered to watch a weightlifter who was putting on a performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With his big arms and bulging muscles, he picked up a 200 kg bag of rice easily in a skip of a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenali was very impressed and exclaimed, &ldquo;You are very strong! Look how easy it was for you to lift a 200 kg bag! But I can hold up something heavier! I will carry this hill on my bare shoulders!&rdquo; &ldquo;How long did it take you to prepare?&rdquo;, Tenali asked the weightlifter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To which he replied, &ldquo;I worked hard for 3 whole months!&rdquo; &ldquo;Since I will be carrying a heavier weight, it will take me more time to prepare, 6 months would be enough!&rdquo;, proclaimed Tenali. &ldquo;And to help me prepare, I will need a comfortable place to stay, nourishing food to eat, and daily massages!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The villagers were really eager to see Tenali perform this miraculous feat, they agreed to host him and his wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each day, he was being brought food and given massages. Tenali and his wife spent 6 months living in luxury while everybody got more and more excited for the main day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the day finally arrived, the entire village gathered at the base of the hill, waiting to see what Tenali would do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenali stood next to the village chief and said, &ldquo;Well, give it to me, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Give you what exactly?&rdquo;, the chief asked, looking confused. &ldquo;You are supposed to pick up the hill!&rdquo; &ldquo;I never said I would pick up the hill, I merely said I would carry it on my shoulders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you not have anyone who can pick it up and place it on my shoulders?&rdquo; said Tenali with a grin on his face.&nbsp;</p>
