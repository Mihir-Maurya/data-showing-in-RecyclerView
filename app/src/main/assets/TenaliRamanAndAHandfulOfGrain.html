<p>A long time ago, there lived a beautiful woman called Ramani in Gantodanagar. She was a learned lady with a good amount of knowledge of different fine art genres.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, because of her pride and arrogance about her abilities, she put a hoarding outside her house that said, &ldquo; I will give a reward of 1000 gold coins to whosoever defeats me in humor, wit, and knowledge of ancient texts.&rdquo; This became an issue of prestige for all the scholars in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of them were offended and tried to defeat Ramani in the war of words, but none of them succeeded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days passed like this. One morning, a vendor happened to pass by her house selling firewood. The man was shouting at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Firewood&hellip;Strong firewood&hellip;. Is there anyone Who wants my strong and long-lasting firewood?&rdquo; The Vendor was shouting continuously and had a shrill and high pitched voice which irritated Ramani.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She stormed out of the house and called the vendor, &ldquo;Oh vendor! Come here! I will buy your firewood. Tell me how much money do you want! Just stop shouting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vendor replied, &ldquo;Madam, I will not sell this for money. I will readily give you all the firewood if you give me a handful grain for it.&rdquo; Ramani promised him to give what he wanted and ordered him to dump the load in the backyard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vendor said, &ldquo;I need a handful of grain, Madam. Do you understand me clearly?&rdquo; Ramani yelled at the vendor, &ldquo;You are asking me whether or not I have understood what a handful of grains mean! Do not try and outsmart me! I am the most learned woman in this entire District. How dare you ask me a question like this?&rdquo; The persistent vendor said, &ldquo;Madam, I pity you! You really do not understand what I want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not able to give what I want, you should pay me one thousand gold coins and wipe the invitation hoarding on the compound wall.&rdquo; Ramani was infuriated. She asked angrily, &ldquo;What nonsense are you saying?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vendor said, &ldquo;This is no-nonsense. I told you what I wanted and you could not provide me with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if you cannot pay the price, you must give me one thousand gold coins for you have clearly failed to understand what I meant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And considering that, I have defeated you in the war of words.&rdquo; A heated argument started between the two and then Ramani decided to approach the provincial Court of Law for justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She presented her argument in front of the judge, &ldquo;My Lord! This firewood vendor is crazy and is talking nonsense. He asked for a handful of grains in lieu of his load of firewood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agreed to give him that but he keeps saying that I do not know what it means and wants me to wipe off the board in front of the house. I plead for justice!&rdquo; The judge asked the vendor what is this argument all about. He humbly replied, &ldquo;Sir, I informed her beforehand that a load of firewood would cost her a handful grain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually wanted one grain that could fill the hand. If she cannot understand this much, she has no right to put up that hoarding in front of her house.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramani was outwitted by the firewood vendor and the verdict was given in favor of the vendor. Ramani was ordered to pay him one thousand gold coins and she also had to take down the hoarding from her wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That witty vendor was none other than Tenali Raman. He was aware of the situation in that district and Ramani&rsquo;s arrogance and pride and had thus taken disguise as a firewood vendor to teach her a lesson</p>
