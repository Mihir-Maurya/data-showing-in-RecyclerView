<h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Short Story of The old Tree with Great Moral</span></h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there were two brothers who lived at the edge of a forest. The elder brother was very mean to his younger brother. He ate up all the food and took all his brother&rsquo;s good clothes and treated him very badly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, the elder brother went into the forest to find some firewood so as to sell some in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he went around, chopping the branches of trees, trees after tree, he came upon a magical tree. The tree said to him, &ldquo;Oh kind sir, please do not cut off my branches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you spare me, I will give you some of my golden apples&rdquo;. The elder brother agreed but was disappointed with the number of apples the tree gave him. Greed overcame him, and he threatened to cut the entire trunk if the tree did not give him the number of apples he wanted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The magical tree, instead, showered upon the elder brother, hundreds of tiny needles. The elder brother cried in pain and laid down under the tree as the sun began to set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The younger brother got worried and went in search of his elder brother. He found him lying in pain under the tree, with hundreds of needles on his body. He rushed to his brother and removed each needle one by one with painstaking love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After he finished, the elder brother apologized for treating him so badly and promised to be a better big brother. The tree saw the change in the elder brother&rsquo;s heart and gave them all the golden apples they could ever need.</p>
