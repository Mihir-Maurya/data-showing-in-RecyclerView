<p>Once upon a time, there was a lion in a jungle.</p>
<p>Once when he had gone to drink water in a stream, his paw suddenly slipped and got stuck in the wet sluggish mud.</p>
<p>He got stuck there without food for days as he did not see any animal pass by.</p>
<p>One day, a kind jackal came by and he dug a way out from the sand, and with a little push from the lion&rsquo;s side, he helped the lion get out from the sand.</p>
<p>The lion felt very grateful for this and thanked the jackal for saving his life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then offered the jackal to live close to him and also promised to feed him whenever he caught food.</p>
<p>The jackal gladly accepted the offer of friendship and started living with the lion sharing the hunts. Soon they expanded their families and had cubs and kid jackals.</p>
<p>After a long time, the lioness, lady of the lion&rsquo;s house, grew tired of the friendship of the jackal and her master.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She did not know that the jackal was the one who actually saved her master. She told her cubs that the lion never wanted to stay beside a jackal.</p>
<p>The cubs in turn conveyed the message to the jackal kids who complained to the lady jackal. The lady jackal told everything to her husband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The jackal went to the lion and told him that if he did not want the jackal to stay with him, he should have told him a long time back.</p>
<p>The lion was surprised at this and assured the jackal that no such ill feelings existed between the lion and the jackal and assured him that he was always in his debt as the jackal had saved his life.</p>
<p>He even told him that he would talk to the lioness. But the wise jackal then said, &ldquo;Friend, I know you are sincere.</p>
<p>But our families may not exactly reciprocate the same bond of friendship that we share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let us stay apart, and meet often as friends and even may go for killing together.</p>
<p>But it is better if my family stays apart from yours&rdquo; The lion agreed to this and the two families parted as friends.</p>
<p>The lion and the jackal remained friends forever and went on numerous hunts together.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Moral of the story:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Don&rsquo;t expect your family to share the same bond of friendship you have with someone.</span></p>
