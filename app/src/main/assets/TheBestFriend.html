<p>Hope you have liked the previous English story. Now let&rsquo;s begin with another wonderful moral story which is short but very interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, two friends were walking down through a desert. At some point in the journey, they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face. The one who got slapped was hurt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, He did not say anything, however, he wrote in the sand, &ldquo;Today my best friend slapped me in the face&rdquo;. They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath since it was really hot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, the other friend saved him without hesitating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone, &ldquo;Today my best friend saved my life&rdquo;. The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, &ldquo;When I slapped you, you wrote it in the sand and now, you have written it on a stone! Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other friend replied, &ldquo;When someone hurts us, we should write it down in</p>
<p>the sand where the winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we should engrave it on a stone so that no wind can ever erase it.&rdquo;</p>
