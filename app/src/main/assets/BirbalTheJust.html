<h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Short Story with Moral about- "Birbal The Just"</span></h2>
<p>Winter had started. The ponds were all starting to freeze. At the court, Akbar asked Birbal, &ldquo;Tell me Birbal! Will a man do anything for money&rdquo;, Birbal claimed,&rdquo; Yes&rdquo; The emperor ordered him to prove it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day Birbal came to the court along with a poor Brahmin who had no money left. His family was starving. Birbal told the king that the Brahmin was ready to do anything for the sake of money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The king told the Brahmin that if he would stand in the nearly frozen pond without any clothes for the whole night, he may get a reward. The poor Brahmin had no choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole night he was inside the pond, shivering. He returned to the durbar the next day to receive his reward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The king asked &ldquo;Tell me Oh poor Brahmin! How could you withstand all that cold along the night and still be alive&rdquo; The innocent Brahmin replied &ldquo;I could see a faintly glowing light a kilometer away and I withstood with that ray of light&rdquo; Akbar got angry and refused to pay</p>
<p>the Brahmin his reward saying that he had absorbed the warmth from the faint light and withstood the cold which will be considered as cheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poor Brahmin could not argue with him and so returned disappointed and bare-handed. Birbal tried explaining to the king but the king was angry and stubborn hence, in no mood to listen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thereafter, Birbal stopped coming to the durbar and sent a messenger to the king saying that he would come to the court only after cooking his khichdi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that Birbal did not turn up for 5 days, the king got curious and he himself went to Birbal&rsquo;s house to see what he was doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Birbal was sitting there and in front of him was a pot tied one meter above the fire. Akbar was amused and questioned him &ldquo;How will the khichdi get cooked with the fire one meter away?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is wrong with you Birbal&rdquo; Birbal, cooking the khichdi and with a grin on his face replied &ldquo;Oh my great King of Hindustan! When it is possible for a person to receive warmth from a light that is a kilometer away, then this khichdi should be cooked very easily as its just one meter&rdquo; Akbar understood the mistake he made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, He called the poor Brahmin and rewarded him 5000 gold coins.</p>
