<h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Rich Man&rsquo;s Son (Moral Story for Kids)</span></h2>
<p>Once upon a time, a rich man&rsquo;s son used to study in a prestigious college. For months, his son wanted a new car but the rich man never granted him his wish even though he had more than enough money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When graduation day came, the young man&rsquo;s father called him into the study, he handed him a wrapped gift and congratulated him on his graduation and his achievement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The son opened the gift to find a lovely leather-bound journal, with the young man&rsquo;s name embossed on the cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, He was very disappointed and angrily he raised his voice, threw the journal without even opening it, and stormed out. The young man left the house. From that day he never tried to reach his father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, He became successful and was wealthy like his father,</p>
<p>with a beautiful home and a family. As years passed, the son realized that his father must be aging and it may be time to put the past behind them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just then, he received a message that his father had passed, and he had to return home to take care of the estate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the mourning son regretfully returned home, he began searching through his father&rsquo;s important papers and saw that his father still had the journal, just as he had left it.</p>
<p>He opened it, and as he flipped through the pages a car key dropped from the back of the journal. A dealer tag was attached to the key that reads- Paid in full. Wherever this car takes you, write about it to remember it forever. Love, Dad</p>
