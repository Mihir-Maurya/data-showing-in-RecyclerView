<p>Once upon a time, there lived a stork who used to pick fishes from the pond beside him and eat them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as he grew older, he found it difficult to catch a single fish. In order to feed himself, he thought of a plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He cunningly told all the animals of the pond including the fishes, frogs, and crabs that some men were trying to grow plants and crops in this pond due to which no life will be possible here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also told them how sad he felt about this and that he will miss them all. The fish was sad and asked the stork to help them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stork, feeling happy inside told them about another big pond and promised to take all of them over there. However, he told them, &ldquo;As I am old, I can take only a few of you at one go.&rdquo; The stork would take the fishes to barren land, kill them, and eat them up. Every time he was hungry, he would take a few of them to the rock and eat them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There lived a crab in the pond, who wanted to go to the bigger pond too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stork was also bored eating fishes all the time so for a change agreed to take the crab. On the way, the crab asked the stork, &ldquo;Where is the big pond?&rdquo; The stork laughed and pointed to the rock, which was filled with fish bones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crab realized that the stork would kill him, he reacted very quickly and thought of a brilliant plan to save himself. He caught the stork&rsquo;s neck and did not let it go until the stork died.</p>
