<p>Once there lived a poor woodcutter. He earned a living by cutting trees in the woods. One day he was cutting wood on the bank of a river. His axe fell down into the river. The river was deep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He could not take his axe out or else he would drown. He sat on the bank and began to weep. Mercury, the god of water appeared. He asked the reason for his weeping. The woodcutter told the god the whole story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mercury dived into the water and brought a golden axe. The woodcutter refused to take it. Mercury dived again and brought a shining silver axe. The woodcutter did not take it either. Then he brought an iron axe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woodcutter took it gladly. Mercury was much pleased with the woodcutter&rsquo;s honesty. Therefore, He rewarded the woodcutter with the golden and the silver axes.</p>
